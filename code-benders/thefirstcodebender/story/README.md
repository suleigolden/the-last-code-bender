## Software Developer

![Open Source Contributor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Source-Contributor-blue?logo=github)

I am a software developer who believes strong software is built not only with features, but with **clarity, maintainability, and shared understanding**.

My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a deep respect for the craft. I enjoy learning systems from the ground up, understanding *why* things work the way they do, and improving them in small but meaningful ways.

Open source, for me, is not about showing perfection — it’s about **continuous improvement**, collaboration, and leaving things better than I found them.

## What I Enjoy Contributing To

- Improving documentation clarity and structure  
- Cleaning up READMEs and developer guides  
- Fixing typos, grammar issues, and broken links  
- Clarifying unclear or misleading comments  
- Adding missing or incomplete documentation  
- Small refactors focused on readability and maintainability  
- Minor bug fixes after understanding full context  
- Issue triage and thoughtful bug reports  

I value understanding the full context before making changes, and I aim to respect existing design decisions while improving quality.

## Philosophy

Good software should be:

- **Readable before clever**
- **Well-documented before optimized**
- **Understandable by the next developer**

I believe learning never stops, and every project — big or small — is an opportunity to grow.
